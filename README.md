# cprd-data-wrangle

This repository is for anyone new to working with datasets released by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Researchers tasked with understanding the database tables, then querying and filtering to create a research cohort, may find our pre-processing pipeline and interactive notebooks a helpful guide to getting started.

ðŸ“¢ This repository will be populated soon! ðŸ“¢ In the meantime, check out this other repository for an introduction to synthetic data, in the context of health-care and biomedical research: https://github.com/aim-rsf/Synthetic-Data
