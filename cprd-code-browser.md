## CPRD's Code Browser 

ðŸ‘‰ Refer to [the CPRD website](https://cprd.com/defining-your-study-population) for information on CPRD's Code Browser tool, particularly the *'How to find the codes used in primary care data'* section, which links to a user guide. 

ðŸ‘‰  A researcher can request access to the Code Browser tool for free by emailing *enquiries@cprd.com*. 

The Code Browser software is designed for Windows OS only.

## Why use the Code Browser?

- It contains additional information to the data specification PDFs as it gives you access to the medical and product dictionaries, allowing you to browse and create code lists that can be used to build your cohort.
- It contains some observation counts (for real data, not synthetic). These counts are rounded to one significant figure for disclosure control. However, the observation counts only show the number of times each code has been used in the Observation file, and not the number of patients who have that code in their record (one patient may have same code multiple times during different consultations).
- For a patient count for a specific condition, CPRD first recommends looking at publications in your area of interest in their bibliography, otherwise you can request a feasible count from CPRD based on inclusions/exclusion criteria.
